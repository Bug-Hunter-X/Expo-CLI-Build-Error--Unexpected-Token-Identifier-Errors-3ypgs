While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, stating something like "Unexpected token" or "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier", without specifying the exact location or cause in my code. The code itself appeared syntactically correct based on standard React Native/Javascript practices.  I've checked for typos, added semicolons where needed, and ensured proper JSX syntax, but the issue persisted.  The error only occurred when building the app for Android or iOS (using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`), and not during development using `expo start`.
