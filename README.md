# Expo CLI Build Error: Unexpected Token/Identifier Errors

This repository demonstrates a strange bug encountered while building a React Native app with Expo CLI. The error messages are vague ("Unexpected token", "Unexpected identifier") and don't pinpoint the problem in the code. The code compiles and runs fine in development mode but fails during the build process for Android/iOS.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic (although seemingly correct) code.  `bugSolution.js` provides a potential workaround.

This issue highlights the need for more informative error messages from the Expo CLI build process.
